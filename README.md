This was a fun project! Upwards of 5 hours, and I am quite happy with the results. It's far
better than I imagined I could have made. Passion really makes a difference.

I did not have a specific structure in mind, but with a few ideals and a bit of planning, I was able to acheive this result. I hope to make improvements upon it by next year, when the nextvalentine's rolls around.

I learned a lot in the process, including CSS animation of fading in and out, have a firmer grasp on HTML audio, images, and the usage of external fonts. It has been quite the learning experience, mashallah.
